You are currently using a beta version of the application made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ren blockchain. Your use of Catalog involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using the Catalog protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the Catalog protocol works. Please also review the relevant laws and regulations in your country before using the protocol. You can access the Catalog protocol through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.\n\nThe Catalog protocol is provided 'as is' and without warranties of any kind. Although Catalog Technologies Limited develops much of the code for the Catalog protocol, it does not provide, own, or control the Catalog protocol, which is run by smart contracts deployed on the Ren blockchain. Upgrades and modifications to the protocol are managed by Catalog Technologies Limited for the foreseeable future until a community-driven and token based development model is feasible. No developer or entity involved in creating the Catalog protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, region of use or your interaction with other users of, the Catalog protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.
